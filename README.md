# simple-game-service

This is very simple service that returns an id and text for a game that is requested in the 'name' query parameter.
e.g. http://localhost:8080/game?name=Chess should return json containing following fields:
{"id":some number,"text":"some string"}

If there is no query parameter then the game endpoint by default sets game to Sudoku, e.g.  http://localhost:8080/game should return json containing following fields:
{"id":some number,"text":"some string"}

id is a counter that increases by a certain amount every time a request is made to the server.
